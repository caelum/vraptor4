#What are components?

Components are object instances that your application need to execute tasks or
to keep state in different situations. 

Common examples of components are DAOs and e-mail senders. The best practices
suggest you should always create interfaces for your components to implement.
This makes your code much easier to unit test. 

The following example shows a VRaptor-managed component:

~~~ 
#!java
@RequestScoped
public class CustomerDao {

	private final Session session;

	// CDI forces the existence of this default constructor
    protected CustomerDao() {
        this(null);
	}

	@Inject
	public CustomerDao(Session session) {
		this.session = session;
	}

	public void add(Customer customer) {
		session.save(customer);
	}
}
~~~ 

Every component from VRaptor is managed by CDI (Context Dependency Injection)
from Java EE 7. Therefore, all capabilities implemented by CDI are present in
VRaptor.

For more information about CDI, check the [Java EE 7
docs](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/partcdi.htm#GJBNR).

##Scopes

It's important to notice that components has its own lifecycle. The default
behavior is that a new instance will be built everytime it needs to be injected
and disposed together with the object in which it was injected (the dependent
scope <a href="">as we will see later</a>).

The following example shows a class to hold email configurations of an
application. Any compoment of the application could receive this object to read
email configurations (notice that this just an simple example, the recommended
way to implement it would be using <a href="/en/docs/environment/">environment
support</a> of VRaptor).

This component has application scope, so will be instantiated just once per
application lifecycle.

~~~ 
#!java
@ApplicationScoped
public class EmailConfiguration {
    private final String host = "smtp.bazinga.com"
    private final String user = "foo";
    private final String password = "bar";

	public Session getHost() {
        return host;
	}
	public Session getUser() {
        return user;
	}

	public Session getPassword() {
        return password;
	}

}
~~~ 

The implemented scopes are:

~~~
* @ApplicationScoped - the component is a singleton, just one for the entire application.
* @SessionScoped - the component is the same during the http session of the container.
* @ConversationScoped - the component instance is kept during a conversation.
* @RequestScoped - the component is the same during a request.
* @Dependent - the component is instanciated whenever it is requested.
~~~

For more information about scopes, check [the Java EE 7
documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/doc/cdi-basic008.htm#GJBBK)
about scopes.

##Building components

Sometimes you need to inject a dependency that isn't from your application, for example 
a Hibernate Session or a JPA EnitityManager.

To do this, you need to create a method annotated with `@Produces`:

~~~ 
#!java
@RequestScoped
public class SessionCreator {

	@Inject private SessionFactory sessionFactory;

	@Produces @RequestScoped
	public Session getSession() {
		return sessionFactory.openSession();
	}

	public void close(@Disposes Session session) {
		if (session.isOpen()) {
		    session.close();
		}
	}
}
~~~ 

See that we are injecting and `SessionFactory`, so we would also need a producer
of SessionFactory:

~~~ 
#!java
@ApplicationScoped
public class SessionFactoryCreator {

    private final SessionFactory factory;

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        this.factory = new AnnotationConfiguration().configure().buildSessionFactory();
    }

    @Produces
    public SessionFactory getSession() {
        return factory;
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void close() {
        if (!factory.isClosed()) {
            factory.close();
        }
    }
}
~~~ 

You can use the listeners `@PostConstruct`, `@PreDestroy` and `@Disposes`
to get notified about the lifecycle of the component and control the allocation
and deallocation of resources.

In the previous example, we annotated the method `init()` that will be executed
right after the instatiation of the class. The method `close()` will be invoked
before the DI container dispose this object.

You can annotate the methods of your VRaptor's components with all of the
mentioned annotations.

##Dependency Injection

VRaptor uses CDI to instantiate components and controllers. Thus, the previous
examples (`CustomerDao` and `SessionCreator`) enable that any controller or
component receive a `CustomerDao` injected in its constructor. To do so, CDI
forces us to implement a default constructor, for example:

~~~ 
#!java
@Controller
public class CustomerController {
	private final CustomerDao dao;

	@Inject
	public CustomerController(CustomerDao dao) {
		this.dao = dao;
	}

	/**
	 * @deprecated CDI eyes only
	 */
	protected CustomerController() {
		this(null);
	}

	@Post
	public void add(Customer customer) {
		this.dao.add(customer);
	}
}
~~~ 

## Observing and firing events

You can fire events and handle them with the `@Observes` annotation.

If you need, for example, log an message during the bootstrap of your application,
you can observe the `VRaptorInitialized` event, like this:

~~~ 
#!java
@ApplicationScoped
public class PrintLog {

	public void observesBootstrap(@Observes VRaptorInitialized event) {
		System.out.println("My application is UP");
	}
~~~ 

See the <a href="/en/docs/events/">events documentation page</a> for more
information about VRaptor's events.


## Overriding components

Most of VRaptor's conventions and behaviors can be customized. It's simple
to customize something: all you need to do is extend an internal class from
VRaptor and annotate it with `@Specializes`. After doing this, the framework
will use the custom implementation instead of the default one.

In case you need to implement an internal interface, you need to annotate the
implementation with `@Priority`, so VRaptor will use your implementation instead
of its own:

~~~
#!java
@Priority(Interceptor.Priority.LIBRARY_BEFORE + 10)
~~~

##Customizing VRaptor

Let's see how we can customize some of the default behaviors of VRaptor.

###Customizing the default view

If you need to change the default rendered view, or change the place where
it'll be look for, you'll only need to create the following class:


~~~ 
#!java
@Specializes
public class CustomPathResolver extends DefaultPathResolver {

    /**
    * @deprecated CDI eyes only
    */
    protected CustomPathResolver() {
        this(null);
    }

    @Inject
    public CustomPathResolver(FormatResolver resolver) {
        super(resolver);
    }

	@Override
	protected String getPrefix() {
		return "/root/directory/";
	}

	@Override
	protected String getExtension() {
		return "ftl"; // ou any other extension
	}

	@Override
	protected String extractControllerFromName(String baseName) {
		return //your convention here
               //ex.: If you want to redirect UserController to 'userResource' instead of 'user'
               //ex.2: If you override the convention for Controllers name to XXXResource
               //and still want to redirect to 'user' and not to 'userResource'
	}
}
~~~ 

If you need a more complex convention, just implement the `PathResolver` interface.

###Changing default URI

The default URI for `CustomerController.list()` is `/customer/list`, i.e,
`controller_name/method_name`. If you want to override this convention, you can
create a class like:

~~~ 
#!java
@Specializes @ApplicationScoped
public class MeuRoutesParser extends PathAnnotationRoutesParser {
	//delegated constructors 
	protected String extractControllerNameFrom(Class<?> type) {
		return //your convention here
	}

	protected String defaultUriFor(String controllerName, String methodName) {
		return //your convention here
	}
}
~~~ 

If you need a more complex convention, just implement the `RoutesParser` interface.

###Changing the application character encoding

For using an arbitrary character encoding on all your requests and responses,
avoiding encoding inconsistencies, you can set this parameter on your web.xml.

~~~ 
#!xml
<context-param>
	<param-name>br.com.caelum.vraptor.encoding</param-name>
	<param-value>UTF-8</param-value>
</context-param>
~~~ 

This way all of your pages and form data will use the UTF-8.
