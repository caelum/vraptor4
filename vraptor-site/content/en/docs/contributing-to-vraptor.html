VRaptor is a MVC Web Framework focused on simplicity and ease of use. When you implement something, be careful to follow good practices of Object Orientation and low coupling, using composition instead of inheritance, convention over configuration and a well-designed code. And don't forget to write the Javadocs and classes of unit tests.

Features like security, paging, multitenant, and others are welcome via plugins and contributions to <a href="http://github.com/caelum/vraptor-contrib">vraptor-contrib</a>.
