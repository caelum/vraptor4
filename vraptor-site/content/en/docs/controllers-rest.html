#What are Controllers?

A controller is a class that can provide resources to be accessed by your
clients. With VRaptor, a controller must be annotated with `@Controller`. All
public methods of an annotated class become accessible through GET or POST requests to
specific URIs. 

The following example shows a controller named `CustomerController`, which
provides several operations over customers. Creating the class below with all
its methods instantly make the URIs `/customer/add`, `/customer/list`,
`/customer/show`, `/customer/remove` and `/customer/update` available, each one
invoking the respective method.


~~~ 
#!java
@Controller
public class CustomerController {

	public void add(Customer customer) { ... }

	public List<Customer> list() {
		return ...
	}

	public Customer view(Customer customer) {
		return ...
	}

	public void remove(Customer customer) { ... }

	public void update(Customer customer) { ... }
}
~~~ 

##Method parameters

You can receive parameters on your controller methods, and if those parameters
follow the java beans convention (getters and setters for class fields), you
can use dots for browsing through the fields. For instance, on method:

~~~ 
#!java
public void update(Customer customer) { ... }
~~~ 

you can receive on the request parameters:

~~~ 
#!properties
customer.id=3
customer.nome=John Doe
customer.user.login=johndoe
~~~ 

and the respective fields will be set, browsing through getters and setters
starting from customer. If an object field or a method parameter is a list
(`List<>` or array), you can receive several request parameters, using square
brackets and indexes:

| customer.phones[0]=+55 11 5571-2751  | if it is a string list
| customer.relatives[0].id=1           | if it is an arbitrary object, you can continue to browse
| customer.relatives[3].id=1           | indexes don't need to be sequential
| customer.relatives[0].name=Mary Doe  | using the same index, it will be set on same object
| customers[1].id=23                   | it works if you receive a customer list as method parameter
{: .content-table}

##Reflection on parameter names

VRaptor uses the [Paranamer framework](http://paranamer.codehaus.org), which can
get parameter names information through pre compilation or debug data, avoiding
the creation of annotations for this purpose. Some VRaptor developers also
contribute in Paranamer development.

##Scopes

Sometimes you want to share a component among all users, or through all
requests from the same user or one instance for each user request. To specify
in which scope your component will live, use the annotations
`@ApplicationScoped`, `@SessionScoped`, `@RequestScoped`, `@Dependent` and
`@Conversation`. If you don't specify a scope for your component, VRaptor
assumes the dependent scope, meaning a fresh instance will be created for each
time it needs to be injected.

Those scopes are from CDI specification, see the [Java EE 7
documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/partcdi.htm)
for more information.

##@Path

The `@Path` annotation allows you to specify custom access URIs to your
controller methods. The basic usage of the annotation is to specify a fixed
URI. The following example shows how to customize the access URI for a method
that accepts POST requests only. The URI we want to specify is `/customer`:

~~~ 
#!java
@Controller
public class CustomerController {

	@Path("/customer")
	@Post
	public void customer(Customer customer) { ... }
}
~~~ 

If you place the `@Path` on `CustomerController`, the specified value will be used as
prefix for all URIs from this controller.

~~~ 
#!java
@Controller
@Path("/customers")
public class CustomerController {

	public void list() {...}

	@Path("save")
	public void add() {...}

	@Path("/allCustomers")
	public void listAll() {...}
}
~~~
By annotating the methods with `@Path` we'll have the following URIs:

|void list()            | URI: /customers/list|
|void add()             | URI: /customers/save|
|void listAll()         | URI: /customers/allCustomers|
{: .content-table}

##HTTP methods

The best practice when designing REST resources is to use the sematincs of each
HTTP method. Therefore, eventually we need to use methods like `GET`, `POST`,
`PUT` etc, for the same URI. In order to accomplish that, we use annotations
`@Get`, `@Post`, `@Delete` etc, which also allows us to configure a custom URI
in the same way as `@Path`. The following example changes the default URIs for
`CustomerController`.  Now we specify two different URIs for different HTTP
methods:

~~~
#!java
@Controller
public class CustomerController {
    @Post("/")
    public void add(Customer customer) { }

    @Path("/")
    public List<Customer> list() 
        return ...
    }

    @Get("/customer")
    public Customer show(Customer customer) {
        return ...
    }

    @Delete("/customer")
    public void remove(Customer customer) { ... }

    @Put("/customer")
    public void update(Customer customer) { ... }

}
~~~

As you can see, we used HTTP methods + a specific URI to identify each method
in our Java class.

We must be **very careful** when creating hyperlinks and HTML forms, because web
browsers currently support only `POST` and `GET` methods. For that reason, requests
for methods `DELETE`, `PUT` etc should be performed through JavaScript, or by adding
an extra parameter called `_method`. The latter one only works on `POST` requests.
This parameter will overwrite the real HTTP method being invoked. 

The following example creates a link to show one customer's data:

~~~ 
#!jsp
<a href="/customer?customer.id=5">show customer 5</a>
~~~ 

Now an example on how to invoke the method to add a customer:

~~~ 
#!jsp
<form action="/customer" method="post">
    <input name="customer.name" />
    <input type="submit" />
</form>
~~~

Notice that if we want to remove a customer using the `DELETE` HTTP method, we
have to use the `_method` parameter, since browsers still don't support that kind
of requests:

~~~ 
#!jsp
<form action="/customer" method="POST">
    <input name="customer.id" value="5" type="hidden" />
    <button type="submit" name="_method" value="DELETE">remove customer 5</button>
</form>
~~~

##Path with variable injection 

Sometimes we want the URI to include, for example, the unique identifier of a
resource. 

Suppose a customer controller application where the customer's unique
identifier (primary key) is a number. We can map our URIs as
`/customer/{customer.id}`, so we can visualize each customer. That is, if we
access the URI `/customer/2`, the show method will be invoked and the
`customer.id` parameter will be set to 2. If the URI `/customer/1717` is
accessed, the same method will be invoked with the `1717` value. 

That way we can create unique URIs to identify different resources in our
application. See the mentioned example:

~~~ 
#!java
@Controller
public class CustomerController {

  @Get
  @Path("/customer/{customer.id}")
  public Customer show(Customer customer) {
    return ...
  }

}
~~~

You can go further and set several parameters through the URI:

~~~ 
#!java
@Controller
public class CustomerController {

	@Get
	@Path("/customer/{customer.id}/show/{section}")
	public Customer show(Customer customer, String section) {
		return ...
	}
}
~~~

##Multiple paths for the same logic method

You can set more than one path for the same logic method:

~~~ 
#!java
@Controller
public class CustomerController {

  @Get
  @Path({"/customer/{customer.id}/show/{section}", "/customer/{customer.id}/show/"})
  public Customer show(Customer customer, String section) {
    return ...
  }

}
~~~

##Paths with regular expressions

You can limit your parameter values using regular expressions using this idiom:

~~~ 
#!java
@Path("/color/{color:[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}}")
public void setColor(String color) { ... }
~~~

Everything that is after the colon is treated as a regex, and the URI will only
match if the parameter matches the regex:

~~~ 
#!jsp
/color/a0b3c4 => matches
/color/AABBCC => matches
/color/white => doesn't match
~~~ 

##Paths with wildcards

You can also use the * wildcard as a selection method for your URI. The
following example ignores anything that comes after the word `photo/`:

~~~ 
#!java
@Get
@Path("/customer/{customer.id}/photo/*")
public File photo(Customer customer) {
    return ...
}
~~~

And now a similar code, but used to download a specific photo from a customer:

~~~ 
#!java
@Get
@Path("/customer/{customer.id}/photo/{photo.id}")
public File photo(Customer customer, Photo photo) {
    return ...
}
~~~

Sometimes you want the parameter to include the `/` character. In that case, you
should use the pattern `{...*}`:

~~~ 
#!java
@Get
@Path("/customer/{customer.id}/download/{path*}")
public File download(Customer customer, String path) {
    return ...
}
~~~

##Specifying priorities for your paths

It is possible for some URIs to be handled by more than one method in our class:

~~~ 
#!java
@Controller
public class PostController {

    @Get
    @Path("/post/{post.author}")
    public void show(Post post) { ... }

    @Get
    @Path("/post/current")
    public void current() { ... }
}
~~~

The URI `/post/current` can be handled by both show and current methods. But we
don't want to invoke the show method with that URI, we want that VRaptor
test the current path first, avoiding the invocation of the show method. 

In order to do that, we can define priorities for `@Path`, so VRaptor will
first test paths with with higher priority values.

~~~ 
#!java
@Controller
public class PostController {

    @Get
    @Path(value = "/post/{post.author}", priority = Path.LOW)
    public void show(Post post) { ... }

    @Get
    @Path(value = "/post/current", priority = Path.HIGH)
    public void current() { ... }
}
~~~

This way, the `/post/current` path will be tested before `/post/{post.author}`
by VRaptor, solving our problem. In case we had the following URI's:
`/post/{post.id}` and `/post/current`, we wouldn't need to define priorities
because `{post.id}` only matches numbers. 

##Paths with header parameters injection

It's also possible to inject HTTP headers into a method using the annotation
`@HeaderParam`.  In the following example the parameter `username` will be
injected with the value of the header `X-Auth-User`.

~~~ 
#!java
public void profile(@HeaderParam("X-Auth-User") String username) { ... }
~~~

**Warning**: In this example, if you had a request parameter named `username`
(from a form, for example) and still define the `HeaderParam` with the same
name of the parameter, it will be overwritten with the header value.

## Consuming in other formats

You can also send the parameter's data of your controller methods in XML or JSON. To do that you just need to add the `@Consumes` annotation, defining the `media type` that the method can accept.

An example would be:

~~~ 
#!java
@Consumes("application/json")
@Post
public void add(Customer customer) {
    customerDAO.save(customer);
}
~~~ 

With this you can do a `POST` request with `application/json` content-type, providing a JSON as parameter. Something like this:

~~~ 
#!json
{"customer":{"id":3,"name":"Paulo"}}
~~~ 

As our JSON has an root element, VRaptor will fill the parameter with the name of the root -- in this case `customer`.

You can also consumes a JSON without root element, as example below:

~~~ 
#!json
{"id":3,"name":"Paulo"}
~~~ 

VRaptor will take care of converting this data automatically to your `customer` object, but in that case, since it has no root element, it's required for `Customer` being the first parameter of the method. 

In other words, deserialization with root will fill the parameter with the name of the root, and on the other hand, deserialization without root will fill the first parameter of your controller method.
 
If the JSON has any property with the same name of some of method parameters, you need to add `WithoutRoot` class into `options` property from `@Consumes` annotation to force deserialization without root element.

~~~ 
#!java
@Consumes(value="application/json", options=WithoutRoot.class)
@Post
public void add(Customer customer) {
    customerDAO.save(customer);
}
~~~ 

In the same way, if you need to force deserialization with root element, you need to add the `WithRoot` class, using the `@Consumes` annotation like this:

~~~ 
#!java
@Consumes(value="application/json", options=WithRoot.class)
~~~ 

You can also to define more than one content type accepted by your method, i.e:

~~~ 
#!java
@Consumes({"application/json", "application/xml"})
@Post
public void add(Customer customer) {
    customerDAO.save(customer);
}
~~~ 

**Warning**: VRaptor will return `415 (Unsupported Media Type)` if the media type is not supported.


## Handling exceptions

VRaptor has an Exception Handler that captures exceptions not handled by your
application.

In the following example, if the method `add(Customer)` throw a
`DuplicatedCustomerException` or any subclass, the user will be redirected to
the method `form()`.

~~~ 
#!java
@Get
public void form() { ... }

@Post
public void add(Customer customer) {
    result.on(DuplicatedCustomerException.class).forwardTo(this).form();

    customerDAO.save(customer);
}
~~~

Anytime you use `Result.on(...)` like that, the exception handler will intercept your exception and leave it accessible as a request attribute named `exception`.  This means that in your 'form.jsp`, for instance, you can do something like:

~~~ 
#!jsp
<c:if test="${not empty exception}">
The following error occurred: ${exception.message}
</c:if>
~~~ 


## Monitoring the exceptions of your project

You can also use the [vraptor-error-control](http://www.vraptor.org/en/docs/plugins/#vraptor-error-control) plugin, that allows you to real time control error messages sending them by email.
