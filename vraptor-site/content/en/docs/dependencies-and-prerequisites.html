#Dependencies and prerequisites

VRaptor 4 depends directly on CDI, so it will work only in servers that support the version used, or higher.
JDK 1.7 or higher is also mandatory. If you're using JDK 1.8, please read <a href="#jdk-8">this section</a>.

The Application Servers already supported and tested are:

* Glassfish 4
* WildFly 8

And Servlet Containers supported are:

* Tomcat 8 and 9 (+ Weld jars)
* Jetty 8 and 9  (+ Weld jars)

To use the mentioned Servlet Containers its also necessary to add
Weld jars and the following listener to your `web.xml` file to activate CDI:

~~~
#!xml
<listener>
	<listener-class>org.jboss.weld.environment.servlet.Listener</listener-class>
</listener>
~~~

And the `beans.xml` file located under your `WEB-INF` (which is optional in case of 
Application Servers) with this content:

~~~
#!xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
	   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	   xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee
	   http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/beans_2_0.xsd"
	   bean-discovery-mode="all" version="2.0">

</beans>
~~~

Some dependencies may differ between applications running in an Application Server
or a Servlet Container. Dependencies from Java EE specification, such as CDI or
Bean Validation, are not required if you are using an Application Server.

# JDK 8

It's possible to use JDK 8 with VRaptor, but is necessary to use the latest
version of Javassist dependency because the previous versions don't support
Java 8 bytecode (note that starting from VRaptor-4.0.1 this is already the
default dependency):

~~~
#!xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.javassist</groupId>
	<artifactId>javassist</artifactId>
	<version>3.18.1-GA</version>
</dependency>
~~~

**Note**: If you are using Wildfly, try to use 8.1+ versions, because Javassist
is already provided by the server. So even defining the dependency in your
application, it won't be used by the application. If you can't update to 8.1+,
an alternative is to update the module directly in the server.

You may also need to add the <a href="/en/docs/plugins/#vraptor-java-8">VRaptor Java 8</a> plugin to your project.

## Maven

VRaptor 4 uses Maven to manage its dependencies. So to add VRaptor to your
project, all you need to do is add the following dependency:

~~~ 
#!xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>br.com.caelum</groupId>
	<artifactId>vraptor</artifactId>
	<version><%= Maven.vraptor_version %></version>
</dependency>
~~~ 

The structure of a project based on Maven is different than the conventional
structure used by most IDEs. However, when a project is packaged, Maven
will build its structure as a WAR:

| Maven Path            | Description                          | Path in the WAR file
| src/main/java         | Java sources                         | /WEB-INF/classes
| src/main/resources    | configuration files                  | /WEB-INF/classes
| src/main/webapp       | web files                            | /
| src/test/java         | Java test sources                    | - ignored -
| src/test/resources    | configuration files for testing      | - ignored -
{: .content-table}

If you don't want to use Maven (or any build tool integrated with Maven
repositories), you can create a project in your prefered IDE and add
VRaptor's jar and its dependencies. All the required jars to use VRaptor are
available in a `zip` file in our <a href="/en/download">downloads page</a>.

### CDI

This is the most important dependency of VRaptor 4. If you're using an Application Server, that already includes this dependency, you don't need to declare it again in your `pom.xml`.

If you are using a Servlet Container (such as Tomcat or Jetty), you need to add the reference implementation of CDI: Weld.

~~~
#!xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.jboss.weld.servlet</groupId>
	<artifactId>weld-servlet-core</artifactId>
	<version>3.0.4.Final</version>
	<exclusions>
		<exclusion>
			<artifactId>weld-jsf</artifactId>
			<groupId>org.jboss.weld.module</groupId>
		</exclusion>
		<exclusion>
			<artifactId>weld-probe-core</artifactId>
			<groupId>org.jboss.weld.probe</groupId>
		</exclusion>
	</exclusions>
</dependency>

<dependency>
	<groupId>org.jboss.weld</groupId>
	<artifactId>weld-core-impl</artifactId>
	<version>3.0.4.Final</version>
</dependency>
~~~

**Warning**: avoid using the artifact `org.jboss.weld.servlet:weld-servlet`.
because contains a lot of unecessary classes to boot a VRaptor
application. Particularly, this artifact contains a **copy** of whole guava
code, which is already a dependency of VRaptor. This may cause several
conflicts between classes of this two artifacts (which can cause typical
classloader problems such as `NoSuchMethodError`s).

## Logging

We use SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) to log internal events. SLF4J can
redirect log messages to several other logging libraries such as NOP, Simple,
log4j and JDK Logging. To configure logging you must add to your classpath the
jar `slf4j-api.jar` and also the binding jar of the library of your choice. See more
about this topic at <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html">SLF4J
official docs</a>.

Most projects choose **log4j** to implement logging. In case you 
want to use it, you need to add the following dependency:

~~~ 
#!xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
	<artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>
	<version>1.7.5</version> <!-- or the latest version avaiable -->
</dependency>
~~~ 

And you should also include a configuration file named `log4j.xml` in the
`src/main/resources` directory, for example:

~~~ 
#!xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration SYSTEM "log4j.dtd">
<log4j:configuration xmlns:log4j="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/">
	<appender name="stdout" class="org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender">
		<layout class="org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout">
			<param name="ConversionPattern" value="%d{HH:mm:ss,SSS} %5p [%-20c{1}] %m%n" />
		</layout>
	</appender>
	<category name="br.com.caelum.vraptor">
        <priority value="DEBUG" /> <!-- or another value such as INFO to decrease verbosity -->
		<appender-ref ref="stdout" />
	</category>
	<!-- include configurations of your project here -->
</log4j:configuration>
~~~ 


**Notice:** If you is deploying you application into Wildfly, you need to
configure logging in the `standalone.xml` file (or in `domain.xml` if
you is running in domain mode):
 
~~~
#!xml
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:logging:2.0">
	<logger category="br.com.caelum.vraptor">
		<level name="DEBUG"/>
	</logger>
	<!-- other content -->
</subsystem>
~~~
 
But if you want to use configuration inside your application, you can
tell to Wildfly to read this configuration from your deployment:
 
~~~
#!xml
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:logging:2.0">
	<use-deployment-logging-config value="false"/>
	<!-- other content -->
</subsystem>
~~~ 

## XStream and Gson

XStream and Gson are used to serialize/deserialize XML and JSON
respectively. Both libraries are optional, so if you don't need to use
serializing/deserializing capabilities, you can exclude those dependencies,
since it's already included as default.

This is the XStream dependency:

~~~ 
#!xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.thoughtworks.xstream</groupId>
	<artifactId>xstream</artifactId>
	<version>1.4.10</version>
</dependency>
~~~ 

And this is the Gson dependency:

~~~ 
#!xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
	<artifactId>gson</artifactId>
	<version>2.8.5</version>
</dependency>
~~~ 

## Bean Validation

If you use an Application Server, it's not necessary to add *Bean Validation*
dependency because it's already bundled with Java EE 7. But if you are using a
Servlet Container, it's required to add a implemetation, such as *Hibernate
Validator*, to your project:

~~~
#!xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
	<artifactId>hibernate-validator-cdi</artifactId>
	<version>5.1.1.Final</version>
</dependency>
~~~

This dependency is mandatory when running in a Servlet Container because
VRaptor uses the Bean Validation API in the `Validator` class.

It's also required to indicate CDI to do not validate methods automatically.
To do that, add the file `META-INF/validation.xml` with the following content:

~~~
#!xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<validation-config xmlns="http://jboss.org/xml/ns/javax/validation/configuration"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://jboss.org/xml/ns/javax/validation/configuration
		validation-configuration-1.1.xsd"
		version="1.1">
	<executable-validation enabled="false"/>
</validation-config>
~~~


## Paranamer

Sadly, before Java 8, it was impossible to use reflection to get parameter's
names from methods or constructors, because this information was not available in
the bytecode (unless the code is compiled in **debug mode**, which is
optional). Because of this, most of the frameworks that need this kind of
information usually create a custom annotation to store parameters names. In
JAX-WS, for example, it's common to find a resource method such as `void add
(@WebParam(name="customer") Customer customer)`.

VRaptor use the <a href="http://paranamer.codehaus.org/">Paranamer</a>
framework which is capable of extracting parameters information through pre
compilation of your code or from debug bytecode, avoiding the use of
annotations. Some of VRaptor's developers are also contributors of Paranamer.

It is worth mentioning that if you pack your
war file with version lower than 2.8 you may have problem with converts as per
example:

java.lang.IllegalStateException: Converter class br.com.caelum.vraptor.converter.ByteConverter

~~~
#!xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.thoughtworks.paranamer</groupId>
	<artifactId>paranamer</artifactId>
	<version>2.8</version>
	<exclusions>
		<exclusion>
			<groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
			<artifactId>mockito-all</artifactId>
		</exclusion>
	</exclusions>
</dependency>
~~~

## Commons-fileupload

This is an optional dependency required only if your application use file
uploading:

~~~ 
#!xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>commons-fileupload</groupId>
	<artifactId>commons-fileupload</artifactId>
	<version>1.3.3</version>
</dependency>
~~~ 

Note that if you are not using any maven-compatible build tool you also need
to add `commons-io` library to the classpath.

## Iogi

**Iogi** is a library used internally in VRaptor to inject http request
parameters. Iogi is responsible for building the beans that you receive in
controller methods. The great benefit of Iogi is that it is capable of
building imutable classes, without the need of **setters**. Iogi is also capable
of building your beans trough setters.

Iogi is a mandatory dependency and it's already included when you add VRaptor
dependency.

## Mirror

[Mirror](http://projetos.vidageek.net/mirror/mirror/) is a library to ease the
use of Reflection, providing a fluent interface to the original API.  Mirror is
used internally to intantiate objects. It is a mandatory dependency and is
already included when you add VRaptor dependency to your project.
